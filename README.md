# mini-vault-ui
Minimalistic Vault UI for non technical users

This tool gives users a very simple and quick UI access to secrets in Vault. It might help you if you have a help desk or other staff not happy with any CLI tool.

Technically it is a small webserver that uses the Vault API on the backend and presents some html forms on the users side.
